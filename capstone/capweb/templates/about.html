                  The Caselaw Access Project (&#8220;CAP&#8221;)
                  is an effort to expand public access to U.S. law.

                The written decisions of state and federal courts in the U.S. are not widely and freely accessible to
                the public online. Instead, they’re maintained primarily in bound volumes and expensive databases that
                few can access. We aim to intervene in this problem by making all published U.S. court decisions freely
                available to the public online.

                What data do we have?
              </h2>
                <p>The short answer is that we've digitized all official, book-published US case law. It's not an
                  exhaustive repository of all opinions— we don't have cases from lower courts, such as tax county and
                  municipal courts, family courts and the like— but chances are if you want to cite it, we've got it.
                </p>

                <p>That includes data for all current state courts, federal courts, and territorial courts for American
                  Samoa, Dakota Territory, Guam, Native American Courts, Navajo Nation, and the Northern Mariana
                  Islands. Our earliest case is from 1658, and our most recent cases are from 2018. In cases where
                  regional reporters were the official reporter for a state for some amount of time, we digitized those
                  too, though we didn't perform the same error correction and metadata generation on non-official cases
                  because they're duplicative. </p>

                <p>
                  Here are some tsv-formatted spreadsheets with specific counts from our collection, and links to view
                  those cases in the API:

                Case metadata, such as the case name, citation, court, date, etc.,
                is freely and openly accessible without limitation.
                Full case text can be freely viewed or downloaded but
                you must register for an account to do so, and currently you may
                view or download no more than 500 cases per day. In addition,
                researchers can qualify for bulk data access by agreeing to certain use and redistribution restrictions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Access limitations on full text and bulk data are a component of Harvard’s
                collaboration agreement with Ravel Law, Inc. (now part of Lexis-Nexis).
                These limitations will end, at the latest, in March of 2024.
                In addition, these limitations apply only to cases from
                jurisdictions that continue to publish their official case law in print form.
                Once a jurisdiction transitions from print-first publishing to digital-first publishing,
                these limitations cease. Thus far, Illinois and Arkansas have made this important and positive
                shift and, as a result, all historical cases from these jurisdictions are freely available to the public
                without restriction. We hope many other jurisdictions will follow their example soon.
