title: Registration

You might not need an account! Most searches, and some API queries and bulk downloads, don't require an account. 
(See [access limits]({% docs_url 'access_limits' %}).) To access case text via the API or bulk downloads from
[restricted]({% docs_url 'glossary' %}#def-restricted) jurisdictions, however, 
or to apply for fully unrestricted researcher access, we do require an account. 

To create an account, either click this [sign up]({% url 'register' %}) link, or:

1. Click on the [LOG IN]({% url "login" %}) link at the top of the screen.
2. Click on the [sign up]({% url 'register' %}) link below the login form.

Fill in each field and click the blue "REGISTER" button.

You will receive an email from our registration system. 
Your account is not active until you click the link in that email.
