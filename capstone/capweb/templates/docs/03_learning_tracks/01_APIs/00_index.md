title: API Learning Track

This learning track offers an introduction to using the CAP API for research.

* What is an API? If you're an absolute beginner and want to learn what APIs are for, 
  check out our [Beginner's Introduction to APIs]({% docs_url 'intro_to_apis' %}).
* How do you use an API? Check out our [CAP API Tutorial]({% docs_url 'api_tutorial' %})
  for an introduction to JSON, curl, and how to use the CAP API to fetch some data.
* What else can the CAP API do? Our [In Depth Tutorial]({% docs_url 'in_depth' %})
  walks through many of its features.

Or, if you're already familiar with RESTful APIs, you may just need our
[API Reference]({% docs_url 'api' %}).
