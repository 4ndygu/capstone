A citation graph allows researchers to explore connections between cases. A "graph" is a list of nodes and edges (connections between nodes).
Researchers want to explore the "citation graph," where nodes are cases and edges are citations from one case to another, to answer questions like "what is the most influential case?", "what jurisdictions cite most often to this jurisdiction?" and "what clusters is this case a part of?"
 

This zipped CSV file is an "[adjacency list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_list)" showing a list of case ids and the case ids they cite to, in the format:

```
source_id, dest_id, dest_id ...
```
