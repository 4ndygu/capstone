title: Access Limits 

Our agreement with our project partner, [Ravel](http://ravellaw.com), requires us to limit access to the full
text of cases to no more than 500 cases per person, per day, until mid-2024.

# Exceptions
This limitation does not apply to 
[researchers]({% docs_url 'glossary' %}#def-researchers) who agree to certain 
restrictions on use and redistribution. Nor does this restriction apply to cases issued in open jurisdictions.

# Open Jurisditions
Open jurisdictions make their newly issued cases freely available online in an authoritative, citable, 
machine-readable format. 

Currently, these are the only open jurisdictions:
 
* Illinois
* Arkansas
* New Mexico
* North Carolina
 
We would love to open more jurisdictions! If you are involved in US case publishing at the state or federal level,
we'd love to talk to you about making the transition to digital-first publishing. Please 
[contact us]({% url "contact" %}) and introduce yourself! Also, check out our 
[information for courts]({% docs_url 'courts' %}).
  
# Research Access
Some users may qualify for unlimited access as a research scholar. For more information, visit our 
[research access guide]({% docs_url 'researchers' %}).


# Commercial Licensing

In addition, under our agreement with Ravel (now owned by Lexis-Nexis), Ravel must negotiate in good faith to provide 
bulk access to anyone seeking to make commercial use of this data.
