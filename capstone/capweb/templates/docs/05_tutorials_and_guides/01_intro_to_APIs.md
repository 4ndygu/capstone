# Beginner's Introduction to APIs  {: class="subtitle" data-toc-label='Intro to APIs' }
  
Are you a little lost in all the technical jargon, but still want to give the API a shot? This is a good place to start!
This is by no means a complete introduction to using 
[APIs]({% url 'docs' 'tutorials_and_guides/documentation_glossary' %}#def-api), but it might be just enough to 
help situate a technically inclined person who's a bit outside of their comfort zone. If you've had enough and would 
prefer to just access the cases using a human-centric interface, please check out our [search tool]({% url 'search' %}). 
  
Fundamentally, an API is no different from a regular website: A program on your computer, such as a web browser or 
[curl]({% url 'docs' 'tutorials_and_guides/documentation_glossary' %}#def-curl) sends a bit of data to 
a [server]({% url 'docs' 'tutorials_and_guides/documentation_glossary' %}#def-server), the server processes that 
data, and then sends a response. If you know how to read a 
[url]({% url 'docs' 'tutorials_and_guides/documentation_glossary' %}#def-url), you can interact with web-based 
services in ways that aren't limited to clicking on the links and buttons on the screen. 
  
Consider the following [url]({% url 'docs' 'tutorials_and_guides/documentation_glossary' %}#def-url), which will 
[perform a google search for the word "CAP."](https://www.google.com/search?q=CAP")
  
    https://www.google.com/search?q=CAP
  
Let's break it down into its individual parts:
  
    https://
  
This first part tells your web browser which protocol to use: this isn't very important for our purposes, so we'll 
ignore it.
  
    www.google.com
  
The next part is a list of words, separated by periods, between the initial double-slash, and before the subsequent 
single slash. Many people generically refer to this as the domain, which is only partly true, but the reason why that's 
not entirely true isn't really important for our purposes; the important consideration here is that it points to a 
specific [server]({% url 'docs' 'tutorials_and_guides/documentation_glossary' %}#def-server), which is just 
another computer on the internet. 

    /search
  
The next section, which is comprised of everything between the slash after the server name and the question mark, is 
called the [path]({% url 'docs' 'tutorials_and_guides/documentation_glossary' %}#def-path). It's called a path 
because, in the earlier days of the web, it was a 'path' through folders/directories to find a specific file on the web 
server. These days, it's more likely that the path will point to a specific 
[endpoint]({% url 'docs' 'tutorials_and_guides/documentation_glossary' %}#def-endpoint).
  
  
You can think of an endpoint as a distinct part of a program, which could require specific inputs, and/or provide 
different results. For example, the "login" endpoint on a website might accept a valid username and a password for 
input, and return a message that you've successfully logged in. A "register" endpoint might accept various bits of 
identifying information, and return a screen that says your account was successfully registered.
  
  
Though there is only one part of this particular path, `search`, developers usually organize paths into hierarchical 
lists separated by slashes. Hypothetically, if the developers at Google decided that one generalized search endpoint 
wasn't sufficiently serving people who wanted to search for books or locations, they could implement more specific 
endpoints such as `/search/books` and `/search/locations`.
  
    ?q=CAP
  
The final section of the URL is where you'll find the 
[parameters]({% url 'docs' 'tutorials_and_guides/documentation_glossary' %}#def-parameter), and is comprised of 
everything after the question mark. Parameters are a way of passing individual, labelled pieces of information to the 
endpoint to help it perform its job. In this case, the parameter tells the `/search` endpoint what to search for. 
Without this parameter, the response wouldn't be particularly useful.
  
A URL can contain many parameters, separated by ampersands, but in this instance, there is only one parameter: the 
rather cryptically named "q," which is short for "query," which has a value of "CAP." Parameter names are arbitraryâ€” 
Google's developers could just as easily have set the parameter name to `?query=CAP`, but decided that "q" would 
sufficiently communicate its purpose. 
  
The Google developers designed their web search endpoint to accept other parameters, too. For example, there is an even 
more cryptically named parameter, 'tbs' which will limit the age of the documents returned in the search results. The 
parameters `?q=CAP&tbs=qdr:y` will perform a web search for "CAP" and limit the results to documents less than a year 
old. 
  
So when you're working with CAPAPI, the same principles apply. Rather than http://www.google.com, you'll be using 
{% api_url "api-root" %}. Rather than using the /search?q= endpoint and parameter, you'll be using one of our 
[endpoints]({% url 'docs' 'tutorials_and_guides/documentation_glossary' %}#def-endpoint) and the parameters we've 
defined. Would you like to see how this works in a real application? 
Head over to our [search tool]({% url 'search' %}), click on the 'SHOW API CALL' link below the search button and 
construct a query. The URL box below the search form will update as you change your search terms. You can hover over 
each field in the URL to highlight its counterpart in the search form, or hover over each input box in the search form 
to highlight its counterpart in the URL. When you've constructed the query, click on the API URL to head over to the 
API, or click on the search button to use our search feature.
  
When you perform a query in a web browser using our API, there are some links and buttons, but the data itself is in a 
text-based format with lots of brackets and commas. This format is called JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation. We use 
this format because software developers can easily utilize data in that format in their own programs. We do intend to 
have a more user-friendly case browser at some point soon, but we're not quite there yet. 
  
OK! That about does it for our beginner's introduction to web-based APIs. Please check out our 
[usage examples](#usage-examples") section to see some of the ways you can put these principles to work in CAPAPI. If you have 
any suggestions for making this documentation better, we'd appreciate your taking the time to let us know in an issue 
report in [our repository on github.com](https://github.com/harvard-lil/capstone/issues). 
  
Thanks, and good luck!
