explainer: Start making legal timelines with our new free tool— Chronolawgic.

# Intro
Caselaw is great— we just love it. That's why we in the Caselaw Access Project team dedicated so many years to digitizing it, cleaning it up, distributing it, writing tools for it, and trying to get the word out about this free resource. However, except for a few people with the right training, it is not exactly... approachable. That's why we're working on some tools and interfaces to help people with the know-how bring the value of this incredible body of work to broader audiences. To that end, we created Chronolawgic— A Legal Timeline Tool.

## Usage

Using Chronolawgic is pretty simple: 

1. start a new timeline
2. search for and add court cases using the provided modal 
3. add non-case events which may span many years, such as wars, cultural eras, or depressions
4. share your new timeline with anybody you wish by copying and pasting the url

## IMPORTANT NOTES

* Chronolawgic is an experimental free tool that does not come with any type of support or guarantee that it will continue to work. If you want us to make this part of our regular, supported platform, let us know! That said, if you have any recommendations for improvements or notice any bugs, we'd be tickled pink if you'd let us know.
* All timelines are public from their inception until their deletion. 
* When you delete a case, event, or timeline, there is no undo functionality!
