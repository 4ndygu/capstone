  {# ==============> ABOUT <============== #}
  <h2 class="subtitle" id="about">Overview</h2>
  <p><a class="btn-primary" href="{% url "search" %}">Search CAP</a></p>
  <p>
     With this tool, we aim to provide a simple interface for locating and viewing the cases and metadata in the CAP
    repository. Right now, this tool is fairly basic. You can use it to search through our cases and some of our
    metadata tables, but there are no advanced tools. If you have any feature suggestions, we'd appreciate your taking
    the time to let us know either in an issue report <a href="https://github.com/harvard-lil/capstone/issues">in our
    code repository on github.com</a>, or through our <a href="{% url 'contact' %}">contact page</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're a developer, you might be more interested in directly accessing our <a href="{% url "api" %}">API</a> or
    <a href="{% url "bulk-docs" %}">Bulk Data</a>.
  </p>

  {# ==============> SCOPE <============== #}
  <h2 class="subtitle" id="about">What's included?</h2>
  <p>
    The CAP search tool searches everything included in the <a href="{% url 'api' %}">CAP API</a>. See
    <a href="{% url 'about' %}#data">our About page</a> for more details on the materials included.

  {# ==============> SEARCHING <============== #}
  <h2 class="subtitle" id="searching">Searching in CAP is simple</h2>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>First:</strong> Choose What To Search</li>
      <li><strong>Second:</strong> Select Your Search Criteria</li>
      <li><strong>Third:</strong> Execute the Search</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <dt>Choose What To Search</dt>
    <dd>
      The search tool allows you to search through several different tables of objects; right now, you may search
      cases, courts, jurisdictions, and reporters. When you first arrive at the search page, it is set to search
      cases. To search for something else, click on "Cases" and select something else from the dropdown menu. By
      default, the search tool is set to search for Cases. To search for something else, click on "Cases" and select
      something from the dropdown menu.
    </dd>
    <dd>
      For example, you may want to search our jurisdiction list. At the top of the search form where it says "Search
      for
      <u>Cases</u>" (or whatever else it might be set to) you should click on the word "Cases" and select something
      else
      from the dropdown menu.
    </dd>
  </div>
  <div>
    <dt>Select Your Search Criteria</dt>
    <dd>
      Within each table of objects, there are several fields you can use to define your search. You could search for
      cases by their citation or by full-text search, and you can search for reporters by their jurisdiction. You can
      even precisely refine your search by using several fields at once. To add a field to your search, simply click
      the
      "Add Field" button, select the field you wish to add from the dropdown, add your search criteria, and press the
      search button.
    </dd>
    <dd>
      For example, if you were searching our Reporters, the default search field is Jurisdiction. Perhaps you'd like
      to
      search for reporters' names that start with a specific word: Press the "Add Field" button, and from the dropdown
      box, and select "Full Name." There is no need to remove any field boxes you don't plan on entering search terms
      into— they will not affect the search results— but it certainly might make complex searches easier to manage,
      visually.
    </dd>
    <dt>Execute the Search</dt>
    <dd>
      Here's the easy part— just click on the Search button. The loading screen should pop up momentarily, and your
      search results should appear below. If there was a problem contacting the search server, or the server returned
      an error with one of your search fields, it appears on-screen.
    </dd>
  </div>

  {# ==============> TIPS <============== #}
  <h2 class="subtitle" id="tips">Tips</h2>
  <div>
      <p>
      You may use as many search field boxes as you like.
      </p>

      <p>
      For Full-Text searching (currently only available in Cases) each separate word is treated as a separate search
        term bound with a logical "and." We don't yet offer phrase searching but plan to implement it soon.
      </p>

      <p>
        Results in metadata searches allow you to efficiently perform a new search for all of the cases related to that
        result. For example, if you're searching our jurisdiction list, each result on that list has a "See Cases"
        button that starts a new search for all of the cases under the specified jurisdiction. Don't worry— you can
        get back to your original search using the back button.
      </p>

      <p>
      You may use as many search field boxes as you like.
      </p>

      <p>
        To share a search, simply copy the URL and pass it along! It will link the user to the specific page of
        results you're viewing. To send them to the first page of results, navigate to the first page of results
        before copying the URL.

        Our caselaw search tool is not kept up to date. It currently has caselaw through
        mid-2018, but may contain many mistakes as well. It is not intended for use in legal proceedings, and we
        cannot provide individual assistance with legal research.
