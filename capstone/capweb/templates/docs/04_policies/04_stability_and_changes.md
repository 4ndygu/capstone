title: Stability and Changes 

The Caselaw Access Project is a work in progress. The format in which the data is served may change, errors will be corrected,
and features will be added and possibly removed or replaced. If your work relies on access to specific data in a specific format,
you should download the data and use local copies. If you have specific concerns about a particular feature of the API or future
availability of specific data, [get in touch]({% url "contact" %}). To see what we've changed recently, check out our
[changelog]({% docs_url "changelog" %}).
