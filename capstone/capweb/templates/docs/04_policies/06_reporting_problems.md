title: Reporting Problems

We are serving an imperfect, living dataset through tools that will forever be works-in-progress. We work hard to hunt 
down and fix problems, but our users will uncover problems more quickly than our small team could ever hope to.
Here's the best way to report common types of errors. You can also always reach us at the [contact form]({% url "contact" %}).
  
* [Our data errata](https://github.com/harvard-lil/capstone#errata)
* [Our issue tracker](https://github.com/harvard-lil/capstone/issues)
* [Our Github repository](https://github.com/harvard-lil/capstone)


# Jumbled or Misspelled Words in Case Text {: data-toc-label='Misspelled Words' } 

For now, we're not accepting bug reports for individual [OCR]({% docs_url 'glossary' %}#def-ocr) 
problems. While our data is good quality for OCR'd text, we fully expect these errors in every case.  We're working on 
the best way to tackle this.


# Website Errors and Missing Features {: data-toc-label='Website Errors' }
